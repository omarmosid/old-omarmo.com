Hi!

I'm Omar. I graduated as an Electical Engineer in 2016. I've always had a penchant for building stuff. If there is something in my mind I (literally :P) don't rest until I've put it onto a computer screen. So I taught myself programming and design and am where I am now.

I also *used* to work for Amazon. But that was a lifetime ago.

I currently work for a startup called <a href="https://montaigne.co/" target="_blank">Montaigne Smart Business Solutions</a> (named after the French guy) as a Developer where I am currently developing a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aqaab/" target="_blank">Design System</a> and Leading our Product Design/Feature Prioritization effort.

If I am not working, I'm either watching Football, supporting my faviorite team: Liverpool Football Club or playing a modern AAA RPG.
